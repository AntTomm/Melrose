The above is my highlighted neighborhood from HC6. Using **matplotlib** & **numpy**, I was able to create a highlighted map of my neigborhood! To improve upon this, in the future I could try & create a more highly specific shape that literally "shapes" Melrose as a whole neighborhood.

The following is HC2, which is our neighborhood analysis. I provided a general photograph of the neighborhood, as well as a Melrose highlighted on a map of Manhattan. Some more fun facts about Melrose are: 

- Tobacco retailers are more prevalent in the **NEIGHBORHOOD** Melrose than in the city at all.
- It was originally settled by both Irish & German immigrants in the late 19th century.
- The overall population was mostly German up until World War 2.
- The number of public schools in Melrose is above average.
